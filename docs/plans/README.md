# Plans

This directory contains dated implementation plans.

## Rules

- Use plans for non-trivial changes, architectural work, or any change where a
  zero-context engineer would otherwise need to rediscover the approach.
- Prefer filenames like `YYYY-MM-DD-short-name-plan.md`.
- Plans should cite exact spec sections when they exist.
- Plans should stay current enough to reflect what is being implemented.
- Completed plans should retain their verification and review notes as history.
- Prefer over-prescriptive plans on risky work: invariants, hidden couplings,
  rollback, rollout, and anti-mocking guidance should be explicit.
- Do not start risky implementation work until the hardening checklist is
  satisfied and the rollback or sequencing story is written clearly enough to
  survive review.

## Standard

Every plan should include:

- goal
- source documents
- context and key files
- invariants and constraints
- dependency-ordered tasks
- testing plan
- verification and gates
- independent review loop
- out of scope
- fresh-eyes review

For risky changes, also include the plan-hardening material documented in:

- `docs/agent-context/runbooks/hardening-plans.md`

Risky plans are blocked if they do not make explicit:

- what must not change
- enough current-structure context to find the right edit point
- what must stay real in tests
- rollback or rollout sequencing when compatibility depends on it
