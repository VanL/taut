# Agent Context Hub

This folder is the canonical shared context for coding agents, automation
agents, and human contributors working in this repository.

## Goals

- Keep one repo-owned source of truth for durable execution standards.
- Reduce drift across agent-specific root files.
- Make planning, testing, and documentation maintenance explicit.
- Make review loops, agent bootstrap, and skill maintenance explicit.
- Keep spec, plan, implementation, and code traceability bidirectional.

## Read Order

1. `decision-hierarchy.md`
2. `principles.md`
3. `engineering-principles.md`
4. Relevant runbook(s) in `runbooks/`
5. `lessons.md`
6. `../lessons.md`

## Runbooks

- `writing-plans.md`: how to write executable implementation plans
- `hardening-plans.md`: required companion for risky or boundary-crossing plans
  that must survive review
- `review-loops-and-agent-bootstrap.md`: how to bootstrap available agents and
  run independent plan/work reviews
- `writing-specs.md`: how to define intended behavior with stable references
- `writing-implementation-docs.md`: how to capture rationale and boundaries
- `testing-patterns.md`: how to choose the right proof and avoid weak tests
- `maintaining-traceability.md`: how to keep docs synchronized during delivery
- `skills-lifecycle.md`: how to add, update, and retire reusable skills

## What Belongs Here

- durable decision policies
- reusable engineering workflow guidance
- short pointers into the canonical lessons ledger

## What Does Not Belong Here

- product or architecture specs that define the system itself
- one-off execution notes for a single task
- agent-vendor-specific syntax that is not reusable across tools

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep files short, operational, and repository-owned.
- Prefer checklists and direct rules over long prose.
- When a repeated mistake shows up, add a lesson in `../lessons.md` and
  strengthen a runbook if the fix should become reusable guidance.
- When plans keep failing at boundaries, strengthen `writing-plans.md` or
  `runbooks/hardening-plans.md` instead of leaving the correction trapped in a
  single plan.
- When a repeated workflow becomes stable and reusable, promote it into a skill
  under `../skills/`.
