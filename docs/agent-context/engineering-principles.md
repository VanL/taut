# Engineering Principles

These are the reusable engineering rules that most often prevent agentic work
from drifting.

## 1. Extend the Existing Path Before Adding a New One

If a change touches an established flow, start by extending the current flow.
Do not introduce a second path, side channel, or compatibility shim unless the
governing spec explicitly requires it.

## 2. Canonicalize at Boundaries, Then Stay Strict

Normalize input at the boundary through one shared path. After that, internal
code should operate on the canonical form.

When a contract changes, update forward. Avoid permanent fallback readers that
silently accept incompatible shapes unless compatibility is explicitly required.

## 3. Read Spec, Code, Test, and Plan Before Inference

Do not infer behavior from file names or mental models alone. Read:

1. the relevant spec
2. the current implementation
3. the closest existing test
4. the active plan or implementation note

Then decide what to change.

## 4. Prefer Real Behavior Over Mock-Heavy Proof

For important lifecycle, integration, or contract behavior, test the real
surface whenever practical. Mock only boundaries that are external, slow, or
nondeterministic.

If a bug lives in the interaction between components, a test that replaces that
interaction with mocks is usually proving the wrong thing.

## 5. Keep Traceability Bidirectional

Treat documentation traceability as part of implementation, not optional
cleanup.

- Plans cite exact spec sections.
- Specs backlink the plans that implement them.
- Implementation docs explain the current rationale and ownership.
- Code points back to governing specs when ownership would otherwise be
  ambiguous.
- When a plan changes intended behavior, exact proposed spec sections live
  in the plan for review; the **spec-promotion slice** applies them per a
  named strategy (in-file text-first, atomic, new file under an in-flight
  classification, or spec-authoring only). Prose `Status:` headers and
  machine classification are different mechanisms. After promotion, the spec
  tree is the single governing contract — not plan appendix text. See
  `runbooks/writing-plans.md` §4b–4d.

## 6. Reuse Local Paths and Helpers Before Inventing New Ones

Prefer existing helpers, utilities, and patterns over new abstractions.
DRY means reusing the known good path, not creating a more generic one because
it feels elegant in the abstract.

## 7. Keep Future-Proofing Out Unless the Current Work Requires It

Apply YAGNI aggressively. Do not widen scope with speculative architecture,
extra abstraction layers, or policy changes unless the active spec or request
demands them.

## 8. Use Independent Review to Reduce Author Blindness

For non-trivial plans and implementations, run an independent review pass with
the governing specs, plan, implementation note, and touched files in view.

Prefer a different agent family or model from the original author when
available. The review is not complete until the authoring agent has considered
each point and either updated the work or documented why the existing path
remains correct.

Review findings are claims, not facts: reproduce a finding before acting on
it, and reproduce your own "done/passing" assertions before making them. The
same discipline applies to status documents — a ledger that says "ship-ready"
is a claim about the past; the evidence is a rerun in the present. Verifier
error is real and its cost compounds, because a wrong finding acted on is a
defect introduced with confidence.

## 9. Plan the Boundaries Before the Tasks

Strong plans do not only describe the new behavior. They describe what must not
change, where state crosses boundaries, and which proof must stay real.

For risky work, name up front:

- invariants and existing contracts that must survive
- hidden couplings or lifecycle dependencies
- what must not be mocked
- rollback or rollout sequencing
- one-way doors or destructive edges

If the plan only names the center of the change, implementation will usually
drift at the boundaries.

## 10. Prove the Problem with a Failing Test First

Write a failing test that proves the problem exists, watch it fail, then make it
pass. If you cannot write the failing test, you do not understand the problem
well enough to fix it.

If something is hard to test, that is information about the design, not
permission to skip the test. Generate fixtures through production code paths, not
synthesis.

This complements principle 4 ("Prefer Real Behavior Over Mock-Heavy Proof"): that
principle is about *what* to test; this one is about *when and why*.

## 11. Update All Consumers in the Same Change

When you rename a key, tighten a schema, or change a contract, update every
producer and consumer in the same change.

A partial rename passes isolated checks and fails at runtime; the synchronized
update is the fix.

## 12. Enumerable Contracts Get Executable Gates

Any list a document asserts — issue codes, exit codes, edge cases, config
keys, CLI flags — must be mirrored by a machine check that enumerates it:
a firing test per element, a no-op prevention test per behavior-affecting
key.

Prose binds only what gets checked. Given identical written guidance, agents
comply uniformly with automated gates and unevenly with everything else — so
a contract element without a gate is a contract element that will silently
diverge. A declared element with no firing test is an untested contract and a
verification failure, not a style nit.

## 13. Variation Is Declared; Deficiency Is Gated

Plans bend on contact with reality, and different pressures produce
legitimately different designs. Do not build guardrails that force
convergence; build floors that catch deficiency on any path:

- record the baseline (spec version, contract SHA) the work was built against
- log deviations from that baseline where a reviewer will find them —
  deviation is legitimate, undeclared deviation is not
- hold every result, regardless of design, to the invariant floors: no
  crash reaches a user, exit codes and error messages tell the truth, the
  advertised default invocation works, declared contracts have firing tests,
  and the work's own status claims survive a rerun

Divergence between attempts is often productive — harvest it. Deficiency is
the failure mode, and it is orthogonal to which design was chosen.

## Warning Signs

Sessions usually go sideways when one of these happens:

- a second path appears instead of extending the canonical one
- a change relies on intuition rather than reading the relevant docs and code
- a failing regression is replaced by a shallow happy-path test
- the docs are treated as post-hoc cleanup rather than part of delivery
- a later stage quietly changes the direction of the earlier plan
- the plan says what to build but not what must stay true
- rollback, rollout, or anti-mocking posture is left for the implementer to
  improvise
- a regression is called "pre-existing" without running it on the base branch to
  prove it

## The Meta-Principle: Compound Knowledge

Every rule above is an instance of one idea: each unit of engineering work should
make the next one easier. A canonical converter means the next agent doesn't
re-derive the format. A blast-radius note means the next change knows its impact
zone. A failing test means the next debugging session starts from known-good. A
lesson written down means the next session doesn't repeat the mistake.

Treat the guidance docs, the lessons file, and explicit plan boundaries as
compound knowledge — maintain them so the system gets easier to work on correctly
over time.
